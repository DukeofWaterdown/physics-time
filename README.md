A fun little combination of physics gadgets and gizmos to keep the gears turning on a rainy day..

This is going to be quite possibly home to some of the most mind-boggling and rationale questioning physics simulations and calculations known to any Grade 12 Physics student but with that aside, it's going to be a wild wild ride.

Enjoy!
